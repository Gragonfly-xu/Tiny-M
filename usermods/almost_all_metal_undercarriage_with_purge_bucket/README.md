## Rationale
The goal was to to create a all meter undercarriage mount inspired in the one created by @Ocho Camino, but using the default BOM extrusions e.g. 3x 130mm long for the 150mm2 version.

A modification of the [Annex purge bucket](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Other_Printer_Mods/tree/master/All_Printers/Purge_Brush_Bucket) was also added.


## Status
Tested and validated in a 150mm bed, though in retrospective some improvements could be made:
- move the z endstop a few milimets up in order to be able to use the default BOM 33mm long shaft.
- dimention the purge bucket for the 150mm bed, the available one might be too long.
- design a mount for a belted z mod

## BOM

150mm Bed:
- 3x 130mm long extrusions, from BOM
- 4x M5x8mm for the lead screw mount
- 2x M5x8mm for the from bed mount
- 4x M5x16mm for the side bed mounts
- 3x M5x30mm for holding the extrusions together
- 4x M3x18mm for holding the extrusions against the carts
- 4x M3x10mm and washers for holding the 90deg corners against the carts
- 4x M5x8mm for holding the 90deg corners against extrusions
- a few other M3x8mm for holding the cable chain and the brush
- 4x 6x3mm magnets for the bucket

190mm Bed:
- not tested / adapted (but should be the same thing as the 150mm)
